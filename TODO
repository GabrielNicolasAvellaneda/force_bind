[ ] If we have more bind calls, we have a problem. Probably we have to use a table like this:
	ipv4 0.0.0.0/80 127.0.0.2/8080
	ipv6 ::/80 ::1/8080
	unix /tmp/sock /tmp/sock1
[ ] Test UDP sendto and sendmsg!
[ ] Probably we have to hijack also dup/dup2/etc.
[ ] Bandwidth per total or per socket. Better, per ip/protocol
[ ] Corrupt data
[ ] Add possibility to change destination of packets.
[ ] SO_PRIORITY
[ ] MTU
